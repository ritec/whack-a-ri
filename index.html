            The following Whack-a-ri game was created after I was not allowed to accompany my programmer teammates on a company outing. See, I had  given my 2 week notice (found another job) some days prior to the outing so it was decided by management and HR I would not partake in   the activities. Trying to make the best of an empty solitary office, I decided to create the following whack-a-mole game clone where you  have to try to whack me on the head as I come out of various random cubicles. When you reach 5 points you get an awesome random corporate prize!
